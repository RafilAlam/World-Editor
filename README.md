# 🌍 Pop-Up World Editor  
📐 **Procedural Worldbuilding in a Stylized 3D Canvas**  
> An interactive 3D world editor built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript** and **HTML5 Canvas**, inspired by the aesthetics of a pop-up book. Dynamically place and remove nodes to sculpt roads, scenery, and landmarks — complete with **procedurally generated trees, buildings, and intelligent traffic systems**, all drawn and animated from scratch using math-heavy rendering logic.
